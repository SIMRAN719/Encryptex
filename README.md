# Encryptex 

> *"The greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places"* - Dan Brown

## 🎭 The Inspiration

After finishing Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code," I was captivated by the mysterious world of cryptography. The *Atbash cipher*, the hidden messages in Renaissance art, the ancient codes that protected secrets for centuries - all of this sparked a burning curiosity. **Encryptex** was born from that fascination.

## 🔐 What is Encryptex?

Encryptex is an interactive web application that brings the art of cryptography to life. It's designed for young adults, students, and curious minds who want to explore how messages can be hidden, transformed, and revealed. Whether you're encoding a secret message to a friend or learning about historical ciphers, *Encryptex* makes cryptography accessible, visual, and fun.

## ✨ Features

### 8 Historic Ciphers
- **Caesar Cipher** - Walk in the footsteps of Julius Caesar (58 BC)
- **Vigenère Cipher** - The "indecipherable cipher" that resisted breaking for 300 years
- **Atbash Cipher** - Biblical cipher featured in The Da Vinci Code
- **Morse Code** - Dots and dashes that saved countless lives
- **Base64 Encoding** - Modern internet encoding from 1987
- **Binary Code** - The fundamental language of all computers
- **ROT13** - The cipher that's its own inverse
- **Reverse Cipher** - Leonardo da Vinci's mirror writing technique

## 🌟 Why Cryptography Matters

In our digital age, cryptography isn't just historical curiosity - it's the foundation of secure communication. Every time you:
- Send a text message
- Make an online purchase
- Use a password
- Access your bank account

...you're relying on modern descendants of these ancient ciphers. Encryptex bridges past and present, showing how simple transformations evolved into the sophisticated encryption protecting our digital lives.
